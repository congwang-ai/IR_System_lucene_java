You can directly import IR_asg2 project into eclipse and run the code. 

The main access is in Searcher Class, it accepcts two arguments, query string and the number of results you want (after ranking). 

The jars are also in the IR_asg2 project zips, containing lucene-core, lucene-queryparser and lucene-analyzers-common. I believe if you import them into eclipse, you don't need to set_path for them.
